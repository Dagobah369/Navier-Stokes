Abstract

This manuscript presents a proof of global existence and smoothness for the 3D
incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, addressing the Millennium Prize Problem.
Our approach relies on the spectral coherence coefficient (C10 ≈ 0.9), a universal
statistical invariant of stationary systems established in [1]. We extend this invariant
to the dynamic velocity field by applying it to the energy spectrum decomposed into
dyadic shells (Littlewood-Paley), normalized by the Kolmogorov (K41) cascade. The
proof is structured around three analytic bridges:
• (A) Detection: We demonstrate that a finite-time singularity (blow-up)
would create a "spectral bottleneck", breaking the local self-similarity of the
cascade and inducing a measurable positive signature (ϵ > 0) in the variance
of the coherence coefficient.
• (B) Exclusion: Using the Leray energy inequality and the spectral stabilizing
role of viscosity, we prove that the dissipative structure of the equations
imposes strict spectral coherence (ϵ = 0).
• (C) Construction: We derive uniform bounds on the enstrophy norm via a
self-adjoint Stokes evolution operator, ensuring no loss of compactness.
The logical contradiction between the spectral signature of a singularity (ϵ > 0) and
the dissipative constraint (ϵ = 0) forces the solution to remain regular for all time.
